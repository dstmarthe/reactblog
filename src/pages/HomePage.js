      <p>
        Not every video tutorial or course has the nuanced information that can
        be found in a written article. Plus, there is the benefit of having the
        static usefulness of written text, which is great for studying,
        referencing, and copy-pasting. While making a bookmarks folder may be
        easier, why not just friggin put it all on one blog, It's the wild west
        out here on the net and I don't need a solid answer as to why I'd code
        and then copy-paste my favorite articles onto here. It was for a course.
        Anyway, visit the articles page for a list of those articles. Each
        article also has recommendations on the towards the bottom.
